Abstract
Cardiac arrhythmias pose a significant healthcare challenge, but existing dysrhythmia classification systems suffer from limited accuracy and adoption by healthcare professionals. To address this issue, our team has embarked on a journey to explore cutting-edge solutions for arrhythmia classification. While many researchers have adopted machine learning and deep learning models, these systems have not demonstrated clear dominance in the field. Therefore, we present our proposed modified convolutional neural network (CNN) model as a promising alternative.

Project Overview
Our project focuses on developing an innovative arrhythmia classification system using a modified Convolutional Neural Network. The main objectives of our research are as follows:

Improved Accuracy: We aim to enhance the accuracy of arrhythmia classification, enabling more precise diagnosis and treatment decisions for cardiac patients.

Advanced Model: Our modified CNN architecture incorporates novel features and optimizations to better capture intricate patterns in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals.

Interpretable Results: We prioritize model interpretability, allowing healthcare professionals to trust and understand the model's predictions.

Features
State-of-the-Art CNN: We have designed and fine-tuned a modified CNN architecture for efficient arrhythmia classification.

Extensive Dataset: Our model is trained on a diverse dataset encompassing various types of arrhythmias, ensuring its robustness.

Enhanced Accuracy: Through rigorous testing and validation, our system consistently achieves high accuracy in arrhythmia detection.

User-Friendly Interface: We offer a user-friendly interface for real-time ECG analysis and arrhythmia classification.
